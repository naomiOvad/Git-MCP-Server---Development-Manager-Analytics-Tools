## Example Questions You Can Ask

### About Team Performance
- "How many commits did we have last week?"
- "Rank developers by commits in the last month"
- "Who hasn't contributed in the last 2 weeks?"

### About Code Health
- "Compare Alice and Bob - who contributed more?"
- "Which files are changing the most frequently?"
- "Who is working on critical files?"

### About Project Activity
- "Show me a dashboard of the entire project"
- "What changed in the last 3 days?"

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git installed and accessible in PATH
- Claude Desktop or compatible MCP client

### Quick Setup (3 steps)

**1. Clone and install**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gitMCP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Configure Claude Desktop**

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\gitMCP\\server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Restart Claude Desktop**

The MCP server will automatically start when you launch Claude Desktop.

## How It Works

gitMCP uses a three-layer architecture:

1. **Git Fetcher** - Runs Git commands with filters (since, until, author, etc.)
2. **Parser** - Transforms raw Git output into structured data
3. **MCP Tool** - Exposes data as Claude-callable functions

Each tool can be used independently or combined for comprehensive analysis.

## Common Workflows

### Weekly Team Report
```
Ask: "Give me a dashboard of the last 7 days"
Get: Activity summary, top contributors, file changes, commit patterns
```

### Identify Bottlenecks
```
Ask: "Which developers are overloaded with work?"
Get: Commit frequency, file ownership, collaboration patterns
```

### Monitor File Changes
```
Ask: "Who modified the authentication module this week?"
Get: Commit history, changes, authors, dates
```

### Track Project Health
```
Ask: "How active is our repository?"
Get: Commit frequency, code churn, active developer count, branch activity

```

## Features

### Natural Language Interface
Just ask questions in plain English. No Git syntax required.

### Comprehensive Analytics
- Commit statistics and trends
- Developer activity patterns
- File change tracking
- Branch management
- Code health metrics

### Real-Time Data
Always working with the latest repository information. Sync with remote anytime.

### Manager-Friendly

## Architecture Highlights

**Async Processing**: All Git operations run asynchronously for performance  
**Error Handling**: Custom exceptions ensure safe, graceful error handling  
**Manager Focus**: Tools return summaries and insights, not raw data  
**Extensible**: Easy to add new analytical tools following established patterns
