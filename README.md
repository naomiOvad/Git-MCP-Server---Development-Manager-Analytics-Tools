## Usage

### Quick Start

Once configured, simply start a conversation with Claude and provide your repository path:

```
Hello! I'm a development manager for the ONNX Runtime project
(C:\Projects\onnxruntime). I'd like to understand the team's activity
over the last 30 days.
```

Claude will use the MCP tools to analyze your repository and provide detailed insights.

### Example Questions

**Weekly Progress Reports:**
```
Give me a weekly progress report comparing last week vs. this week.
How many commits, developers, and lines of code changed?
```

**Team Performance:**
```
Who are the top 10 most active developers this month?
Show me their commit counts and code contributions.
```

**Individual Analysis:**
```
Give me a detailed report on developer@example.com:
- How many commits in the last 30 days?
- What files did they work on?
- What was her contribution, and how did it impact the project?
```

**Trend Analysis:**
```
Compare activity across the last 3 months. Is the team becoming
more or less productive? Show me the numbers.
```

**Branch Management:**
```
Which branches has john.doe@company.com worked on recently?
Show me his commits and the names of the branches he worked on.
```

**Developer Comparison:**
```
Compare these 3 developers and their work styles. Who focuses on
what areas? How do their contributions differ?
```

**Tool Sequence:**
1. `get_commit_history` (both periods) → Gather commit data
2. `get_developer_stats` (multiple developers) → Individual metrics
3. `compare_developer_stats` → Ranking and comparison

### Code Review Prioritization
**Question:** "What files need urgent code review?"

**Tool Sequence:**
1. `get_project_dashboard` → Identify hotspot files
2. `get_commit_history` → Detailed change analysis
3. Response prioritizes files by activity and risk

### Developer Performance Analysis
**Question:** "Show me john.doe@company.com performance, compare to team, and list his recent commits"

**Tool Sequence:**
1. `get_developer_stats` (target developer) → Individual metrics
